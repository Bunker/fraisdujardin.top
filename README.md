# Fraisdujardin.top or homegrown.top

This project is build out of the need to build an application to streamline and in a way automate the selling of extra vegetables in my garden to neighbours, friends and collegues.

The basis of this application is the [e-commerce tutorial][2] by [envatotuts+][1]
I adapted this code to my specific needs, if you are interested you can find the original code in their [github project][3]

Version 1:
--------
	- Build database with available vegetables, easy to update only by me
	- Reservation system for later pickup by client and preparation by me
	- Dynamic updating of the available items when reservation is completed
Version 2:
--------
	- Add payment system through paypal and/or bitcoin
Version 3:
--------
	- Let other producers add their products
Version 4:
--------
	- Order by facebook / slack / signal messenger bot
Version 5:
--------
	- couple the site to an IoT locker in the garden to pick up items
Version 6:
----------
	- Let users vote what to plant in certain beds
